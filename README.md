# React Drag Drop Test

To run, first `cd` to the repo cloned directory, and then:
```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```
This supposed to automatically open the browser and show the app.  
If the browser not opening, try: [http://127.0.0.1:9898](http://localhost:9898)

If it's not working (I didn't test it on windows) do:
```bash
npm run build
```
After the build is finished, just open the `public/index.html` file in your browser.
